// sqlx reaches out to Postgres at compile-time to check that queries are well-formed. Just like sqlx-cli commands, it relies on the DATABASE_URL environment variable to know where to find the database
// sqlx will read DATABASE_URL from it and save us the hassle of re-exporting the environment variable every single time.
// this is only needed for compiling, during runtime the configuration.yaml is used to change the db connection
DATABASE_URL="postgres://postgres:password@localhost:5432/newsletter"
